Hey, I'm Alick, a Network Engineer based in the UK.

I come from a background of Linux system administration and engineering, working in positions in hosting, dealing with Asterisk PBX's, to more industrial settings with large deployments of thin clients. 

A few years back though I moved into a role where I administered a large IT infrastructure of which Linux was the main OS, but  the site also had a large on-site network infrastructure, plus was a hub for branch sites. This led me to spending more time developing my networking skills, and moving eventually over to becoming a Network Engineer. 

Most of my time revolves around working on Networking, Linux and Security projects and study. But as with most guys in this sector, I get excited over just about all aspects of Computing and Tech.

I put this site together just as a place to let me put [down on digital paper](https://cablekitten.co.uk), some of the topics that I'm working on.

The name of the site, comes from my love of cats, but any fluffy mammal usually has me wrapped around their paw.
