- I come from a background of Linux system administration and engineering, but a few years back made the move over to networking, after finding in my current role a huge on-site network infrastructure(21 IDFs), plus being the hub for branch sites. Having an understanding not only helped when delaing with TB and solution development, but was essential.

- Most of my studying resolves around Networking, Linux and Security. But as with a lot of us guys in this sector, I get excited over just about all aspects of Computing.

- I love cats, hence the site name, but also any fluffy mammal usually has me wrapped around their paw.
