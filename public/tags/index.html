      Generic Routing Encapsulation(GRE) tunnels are a technology that was developed by Cisco but, is now an open standard through RFC 2784. GRE tunnels can provide use with a lot of versatility when needing to move different protocols between networks. Though we have now moved into an era that is predominantly TCP/IP, when GRE was developed it was at a time of multiple network technologies, IPX, Appletalk, Token Ring, etc, flourished. GRE provided the ability to encapsulate these technologies and let them traverse an Internet Protocol network.

      Whilst recently recertifying for my LFCS the networking section had been further expanded and now included static routes. I thought this was fantastic. Though I know a lot of people use linux, I doubt many get down into the plumbing, and work with the networking on their machines. This is just going to be a little walk through of setting up a static route.
Static routes can come in handy for connecting environments with multiple networks.

      I passed my Linux Foundation Certified Systems Administrator Exam a few weeks back. This was a recertification. Since I last took the exam the syllabus has been overhauled. Where previously you would choose between CentOS and Ubuntu, they have now gone for a vendor neutral approach.
I was hoping for the release of the new LFCE, but I fear that this is never coming. I did message the team a year ago and was told it was in development, but haven&rsquo;t seen any update.

      The Embedded Event Manager is a brilliant tool that can be found in the Cisco IOS. Before the development of IOS-EX, devices were limited to TCL and EEM to implement scripting locally on the device. Though we now get python available to us, TCL and EEM are still very useful.
I&rsquo;m just going to roll through a simple example of using EEM. We have a Primary and a Backup Circuit in our environment, but prefer to keep the interface of the Backup circuit shutdown when the Primary is active.

Resources Core Books I would read every morning as soon as I woke. This way I guaranteed that I covered something everyday regardless of what got in the way.

      The Embedded Event Manager is a brilliant tool that can be found in the Cisco IOS. Before the development of IOS-EX, devices were limited to TCL and EEM to implement scripting locally on the device. Though we now get python available to us, TCL and EEM are still very useful.
I&rsquo;m just going to roll through a simple example of using EEM. We have a Primary and a Backup Circuit in our environment, but prefer to keep the interface of the Backup circuit shutdown when the Primary is active.

      I passed my Linux Foundation Certified Systems Administrator Exam a few weeks back. This was a recertification. Since I last took the exam the syllabus has been overhauled. Where previously you would choose between CentOS and Ubuntu, they have now gone for a vendor neutral approach.
I was hoping for the release of the new LFCE, but I fear that this is never coming. I did message the team a year ago and was told it was in development, but haven&rsquo;t seen any update.

      I passed my Cisco ENCOR exam just over a month ago. I took it on the last day of V1.0. Thought I&rsquo;d give an overview of the resources I used and how I found things. Obviously the Exam has now changed, so other resources maybe required.
Resources Core Books I would read every morning as soon as I woke. This way I guaranteed that I covered something everyday regardless of what got in the way.
