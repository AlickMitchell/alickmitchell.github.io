      <description>&lt;p&gt;I passed my Linux Foundation Certified Systems Administrator Exam a few weeks back. This was a recertification. Since I last took the exam the syllabus has been overhauled. Where previously you would choose between CentOS and Ubuntu, they have now gone for a vendor neutral approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was hoping for the release of the new LFCE, but I fear that this is never coming. I did message the team a year ago and was told it was in development, but haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any update. This will be a future decider for whether to stay with the Linux Foundation or move over to the Red Hat certification track. As there isn&amp;rsquo;t any advancement, only lateral movement through the Kubernetes certifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
