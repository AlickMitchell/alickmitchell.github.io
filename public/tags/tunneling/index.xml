      <description>Generic Routing Encapsulation(GRE) tunnels are a technology that was developed by Cisco but, is now an open standard through RFC 2784. GRE tunnels can provide use with a lot of versatility when needing to move different protocols between networks.

GRE provided the ability to encapsulate these technologies and let them traverse an Internet Protocol network.</description>
