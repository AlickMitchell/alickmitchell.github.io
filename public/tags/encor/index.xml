      <description>I passed my ENCOR just over a month ago. I took it on the last day of V1.0. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d give an overview of the resources I used and how I found things. Obviously the Exam has now changed, so other resources maybe required.&#xA;Resources Core Books I would read every morning as soon as I woke. This way I guaranteed that I covered something everyday regardless of what got in the way.</description>
