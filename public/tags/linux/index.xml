      <description>When using Linux you&amp;rsquo;ll come to use a certain group of tools daily. In your tool bag you&amp;rsquo;ll no doubt have a worn grep, a shiny sed, a beat up awk, and a collection of other well used tools. One of my personal favourites is find.&#xA;Find allows us to pinpoint a specific file by name, or by a certain characteristic. We can link these search options together to work with very granular patterns to match against.</description>

      <description>Though Linux is usually thought of as a server OS. It has huge amount of other implementations from embedded systems, the world of IOT, the mobile phone sector, and we&amp;rsquo;re all still waiting for the year of the Linux Desktop(sure it&amp;rsquo;ll be this year). But a function that is often over looked is the available routing protocol suite that eanbles linux to function as a router.&#xA;The routing protocol suite started off as a project called Zebra, which after becoming discontinued morphed into Quagga Routing Software.</description>

      <description>Generic Routing Encapsulation(GRE) tunnels are a technology that was developed by Cisco but, is now an open standard through RFC 2784. GRE tunnels can provide use with a lot of versatility when needing to move different protocols between networks. Though we have now moved into an era that is predominantly TCP/IP, when GRE was developed it was at a time of multiple network technologies, IPX, Appletalk, Token Ring, etc, flourished. GRE provided the ability to encapsulate these technologies and let them traverse an Internet Protocol network.</description>

      <title>Linux Static Route</title>

      <description>Whilst recently recertifying for my LFCS the networking section had been further expanded and now included static routes. I thought this was fantastic. Though I know a lot of people use linux, I doubt many get down into the plumbing, and work with the networking on their machines. This is just going to be a little walk through of setting up a static route.&#xA;Static routes can come in handy for connecting environments with multiple networks.</description>

      <title>My LFCS Journey</title>

      <description>I passed my Linux Foundation Certified Systems Administrator Exam a few weeks back. This was a recertification. Since I last took the exam the syllabus has been overhauled. Where previously you would choose between CentOS and Ubuntu, they have now gone for a vendor neutral approach.&#xA;I was hoping for the release of the new LFCE, but I fear that this is never coming. I did message the team a year ago and was told it was in development, but haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any update.</description>
