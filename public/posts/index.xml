      <description>The Embedded Event Manager is a brilliant tool that can be found in the Cisco IOS. Before the rollout of IOS-EX Cisco was limited to TCL and EEM to implement scripting locally on the device. Though we now get python available to us, TCL and EEM are very useful.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m just going to roll through a use of EEM when we lose our Primary Connection and need to flip to our backup.</description>

      <description>Whilst recently recertifying for my LFCS the networking section had been further expanded and now included static routes. I thought this was fantastic. Though I know a lot of people use linux, I doubt many get down into the plumbing, and work with the networking on their machines. This is just going to be a little walk through of setting up a static route.&#xA;Static routes can come in handy for connecting environments with multiple networks.</description>

      <description>I passed my Linux Foundation Certified Systems Administrator Exam a few weeks back. This was a recertification. Since I last took the exam the syllabus has been overhauled. Where previously you would choose between CentOS and Ubuntu, they have now gone for a vendor neutral approach.&#xA;I was hoping for the release of the new LFCE, but I fear that this is never coming. I did message the team a year ago and was told it was in development, but haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any update.</description>

      <description>I passed my ENCOR just over a month ago. I took it on the last day of V1.0. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d give an overview of the resources I used and how I found things. Obviously the Exam has now changed, so other resources maybe required.&#xA;Resources Core Books I would read every morning as soon as I woke. This way I guaranteed that I covered something everyday regardless of what got in the way.</description>
