Thought I&rsquo;d give an overview of the resources I used and how I found things.
Obviously the Exam has now changed, so other resources maybe required.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<h3 id="core-books">Core Books</h3>
<p>I would read every morning as soon as I woke. This way I guaranteed that I covered something everyday regardless of what got in the way.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-and-ccie-enterprise-core-encor-350-401-official-9780135262030">CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Though I feel that most of the exam was covered by the OCG. I would recommend further reading around topics to develop confidence in the technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/31-days-before-your-ccnp-and-ccie-enterprise-core-exam-9780136965220">31 Days Before Your CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core Exam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This was my favourite book. It&rsquo;s very dog-eared now, and I actually enjoyed reading this. Though it&rsquo;s meant to be for the last month of study, I actually used it throughout.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-and-ccie-enterprise-core-ccnp-enterprise-advanced-9780135768167">CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core &amp; CCNP Enterprise Advanced Routing Portable Command Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a handy book to keep on the desk when labbing. When you want to clarify a specific config. The sections can also be worked through as well. I liked working through the tunneling section.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.informit.com/store/ccnp-and-ccie-enterprise-core-encor-350-401-exam-cram-9780136891932">CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Exam Cram</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Not a bad book, but preferred the 31 Days Before. It provides a good overview, but found that it wasn&rsquo;t detailed enough.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-enterprise-core-networking-encor-v8-lab-manual-9780136906438">CCNP Enterprise: Core Networking (ENCOR) v8 Lab Manual</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This provides a good set of Labs. Setting them up is time-consuming, so I found when building them in GNS3, I&rsquo;d use the snapshots funciton. This meant I only had to build them once.</p>
<h4 id="additional-reading">Additional Reading</h4>
<p>The following books I used parts of to help me understand concepts more thoroughly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/title/9780135262054">CCNP Enterprise Advanced Routing ENARSI 300-410 Official Cert Guide Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ikev2-ipsec-virtual-private-networks-understanding-9781587144608">IKEv2 IPsec Virtual Private Networks: Understanding and Deploying IKEv2, IPsec VPNs, and FlexVPN in Cisco IOS</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/cisco-software-defined-access-9780136448389">Cisco Software-Defined Access</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/cisco-express-forwarding-9780133433340">Cisco Express Forwarding</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/qos-for-ip-mpls-networks-9780133434996">QoS for IP/MPLS Networks</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/tcl-scripting-for-cisco-ios-9780133433739">TcL Scripting for Cisco IOS</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="videoplatform-based-training">Video/Platform Based Training</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco/ccnp-enterprise-core">CBT Nuggets - CCNP Enterprise (350-401 ENCOR)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I really like CBT Nuggets and the trainers over there. I feel they&rsquo;re ENCOR course provides a good base. If using CBT Nuggets I&rsquo;d recommend mixing in some of the specialist course, such as the deeper dives of BGP, OSPF, QOS.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ine.com/learning/paths/ccnp-enterprise">INE - CCNP Enterprise Learning Path</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Out of all the providers, INE is my favourite. I prefer the long form videos, where you can spin up the same lab in GNS3/Eve-ng and work along side the trainer. The videos are really in depth, and I&rsquo;d say go beyond the point required for the Exam.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-and-ccie-enterprise-core-encor-350-401-complete-9780136584124">LiveLessons - CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Complete Video Course</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It provides a good coverage of the blueprint. More heavy on concepts than showing practical walk throughs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8sdl8H3cY&amp;list=PLOpoM7HdItaLzI-ikzNRbeE-6JJJV2tSu">KishSquared - ENCOR Study Group</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a nice collection of videos that Jeff put together that covers parts of the syllabus.</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="practice-exams">Practice Exam&rsquo;s</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.boson.com/practice-exam/350-401-ENCOR-cisco-ccnp-practice-exam">Boson.com - ExSim-Max for Cisco 350-401 ENCOR</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The gold standard for Exams. The answers for the questions are very detailed. I&rsquo;d recommend using the links to the Cisco Documentation, this will help you become familiar with using Cisco Documentation. These were most like the exam.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/assessments-and-practice-exams/cisco-exam-review-encor/CER-ENCOR-V1-026006.html">The Cisco Learning Network - Cisco Exam Review ENCOR</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good learning tool. I found it more heavy on labs than the real exam, but that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. I liked this, but the answers aren&rsquo;t as detailed as Boson.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-and-ccie-enterprise-core-encor-350-401-official-9780138216764">Pearson Test Prep</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are not at the same level as the Exam, but are a good learning tool to mix in with your learning strategy.</p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>In all truthfulness, none of the Video series covered the Automation section very well.</p>
<p>Luckily, DevNet has a good course.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/video/net-prog-basics/">Learn network programmability basics</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="labbing">Labbing</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gns3.com/">GNS3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My personal preference is to use GNS3. Though I have a hardware lab, I found that I did 90% of my ENCOR specific labs in GNS3.</p>
<p>The only exception being WLC involved labs. I had to connect my WLC from my home lab to GNS3 for my wireless labs, only as I didn&rsquo;t have a WLC image at the time. I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a WLC just for the ENCOR. Keith Barker has some packet tracer labs  that I think will provide enough of a feel of a WLC for the Exam.</p>
<h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Habit</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of touching something daily.</p>
<p>I got into the habit of opening the blueprint and my study spreadsheet when I start a study session. Just to drill home what was, and wasn&rsquo;t on the blueprint.</p>
<p>Create a study spreadsheet. I broke down the blueprint into a spreadsheet, and found it invaluable to make sure that I&rsquo;d covered each topic thoroughly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a good note-taking system. I find noting taking whilst following more concept based training keeps my mind from wandering.</p>
<p>I also find the process of working through my notes and editing them later solidifies the concepts.</p>
<p>But the biggest benefit I find to taking notes is creating your own engineers notebook. Having previous solutions that you&rsquo;ve created, with notes stops the &ldquo;recreation of the wheel&rdquo; problem. This becomes a tool not just for the exam but for your career.</p>
<p>I keep organized notes using org mode in Emacs. Emacs has modules that help you search and sort your notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Cisco white papers and documentation are your friend. Learning to navigate the documentation is a skill all of its own, and it pays a huge dividend once you nail it.</p>
<p>Obviously these are just things that I personally found helpful, everyone has a different study style.</p>
<h2 id="mistakes">Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Going too deep on topics</li>
</ul>
<p>The exam has a huge curriculum. I struggle with just learning what you need to learn. When I start a topic I find interesting, I can&rsquo;t help but dive deep into that topic. You just can&rsquo;t with this exam. You really have to stick to the blueprint. This is a skill that I had to learn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Covering material that you know</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that I can end up covering material that I already know, just because it&rsquo;s in a learning path of a course or in a chapter in a book. I have a bit of a tick box obsession. This doesn&rsquo;t help with time management, be confident if you do know a topic to say, I don&rsquo;t need to cover this again and spend that time in an area that does.</p>
<h2 id="my-take-away">My Take Away</h2>
<p>If you had asked me my opinion of the ENCOR whilst I was studying for it, you would have got some discouraging comments peppered with some blue language. Now at the end of it, I do understand why it has the breadth that it does. I feel it has made me a more complete engineer. It was a worthwhile course, and I would recommend it.</p>
